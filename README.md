# 🛒 ShoppingListApp

A modern Android shopping list application built with **Clean Architecture**, **MVVM**, and **Jetpack Compose**. While functional as a note-taking shopping list app, its **primary value lies as a comprehensive template** for Android developers seeking to implement best practices in modern Android development.
